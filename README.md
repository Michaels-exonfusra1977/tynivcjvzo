Just walked out of the theater, floored and dizzy. Borderline is still circling my brain like a faulty fan. Why's it always so sticky in theaters? Popcorn rained down my shirt. Back aching—front row was a baadd idea. Kind of like trying to parallel park in a raging storm, no clarity, just chaos.

Why didn't anybody tell me the movie was a fever dream? Opening scene slapped me in the face. Like, literally, a guy in a bunny mask just... there. Made my brain stall like a rusty old truck. The music—boom, boom, boom—like they stole it from a nightclub that's lost its way too.

> Could barely hear the dialogue over the guy snoring behind me, at least one of us was relaxed. That bank heist scene—felt like they were robbing my sanity. The colors so harsh they scratched my eyeballs, like trying to paint with acid.

I was sure someone asked me to download the movie, watch it in peace, but peace is a concept they’ve long abandoned here. Felt like I was told to swim through jello—I mean, I get it, art or whatever, but holy hell, my brain's in knots.

That part when she confronts her shadow, or maybe it was her clone? Not sure, but it resonated like a sad sax in a subway tunnel. Was it supposed to mean something? A metaphor for society? Or just for me having too much soda and now needing the restroom so bad I could’ve run a marathon just to release the tension?

The actors—I remember their faces but like dreams you can't pin down. They acted like life but sounded like echoes in a tin can. And that ending? I'm still question-writing on sand, waiting for the tide to give me answers. Or subtitles.

Remember to tell Joe: watch the movie, if he dared traversed the twisting corridors of his own sanity. I think I've broken free temporarily or maybe I'm still caught in its web. Who knew movies could be such a confusing buffet of emotions, like marshmallows melting over nachos. 

Code. Or cheese. I don't know, same difference at this point.

```csharp
if (mind.isBlown)
{
    return new ThoughtFragment();
    while (true)
    {
        try
        {
            throw new MeaningException(What even...);
        }
    }
}
```
